# R data cheatsheet

These are notebooks that describe tasks that I use when working with data for journalism in R but don't do often enough to remember off the top of my head.

## Finding data

- [Search census variables](notebooks/search_census_variables.Rmd)

## Transforming data

- [Group by part of a date variable](notebooks/group_by_month_or_year_from_date.Rmd)

## Testing

- [Run testthat tests in a single file](notebooks/run_tests_in_a_single_file.Rmd) 

## Other resources

- [How Do I? â€¦](https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/HowDoI.html): Sharon Machlis has made a searchable table of tasks in R to accompany her book [Practical R for Mass Communication and Journalism](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918).
